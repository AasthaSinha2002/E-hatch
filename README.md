### Case Study:
India has 105 unicorns with funding over $93 billion. Shark Tank India has done its bit to increase awareness about the startup landscape, however this has hardly scratched the surface. A lot of the nation's entrepreneurial potential still remains untapped due to the lack of a support system. Thus, nurturing entrepreneurs requires a platform that provides robust support throughout the entire process to convert brilliant ideas into solid business models.

###Proposed Solution:
E-hatch is a one stop solution for connecting mentors with enterprising people. Creative program, product designed to enhance continued associations between mentors and entrepreneurs.

###USP:
Communities lacking in startup India
Video Chat â€“ no API or third party connection 
Automatic community management 
Lectures from mentors
